I enjoy every moment of the day Be happy is my motto
I am joyful everyday and create joy for others
In this moment I feel peaceful and content
Today is going to be a really, really Good Day
I love myself and I also myself to bee loved fully 
Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happenedFor every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happinessThe biggest men and women with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest men and women with the smallest mind. Think big anyway .Folks are usually about as happy as they make their minds up to beHappiness is an Art
today is a great day
