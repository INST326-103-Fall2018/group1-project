I've survived this before, and I'll survive now!
Take a deep breath in and out and think about something that makes you happy!
At this moment, I choose to release the past and look forward to the good that awaits me.
I choose to fill my mind with positive and healing thoughts.
There are no mistakes, only lessons to be learned.Stay in your peace zone
Be content with who you are
Think of happy thoughts and the ocean
