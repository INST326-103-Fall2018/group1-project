Instructions for Affirmation File
  1. Download the file "Affirmation File".
  
  2. Download all of the affirmation text for the files. (annoyed.txt, happy.txt, anxious.txt, sad.txt and upset.txt)
  #your program will not run properly unless you download all 5 files.
  
  3. If you are using sublime please make sure you run everything in your terminal. Also please make sure all of your files are in the same directory.
  
  4. Once you run the program the user will display the current time in a 24-hour format and ask you how you are feeling
  
  5. It will also ask you to enter the number that corresponds with your emotion.
  
  6. Once you enter your response it will chose a random line from the corresponding emotion file and print it in the terminal.
  
  7. It will then ask you if you would like to add a new affirmation to the file.
  
  8. If you select no then the program will say 'bye' and it will break.
  
  9.  If you choose yes then the affirmation that you type in will be displayed in the file that corresponds with the emotion you chose earlier in the program
  
  10. Now when you ask for an affirmation it is possible (since it is random) that the program will send you an affirmation that you created previously.
